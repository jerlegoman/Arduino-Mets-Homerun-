# Automated-Mets-Homerun
I had the idea for this project since 2015. I always thought this would be a really cute project. 
Imagine watching the mets game and the mets score a run. 
This would be such a cool little thing.
I just never got arround to it until now. Anyway...

My plan is to create a motorized mets homerun apple with a 3D Printer, a stepper motor and a microcontroller, 
Either an arduino of some sort or a Raspberry Pi Pico W.
I have most of the code complete so far. Next steps are as follows:
1. Design the 3D Designs including the apple and the enlosure it will pop out of.
2. Deisgn the circuitry
3. Workout the mechanics

I first wrote the "psudo-code" in javascript and then ported it over to python.
